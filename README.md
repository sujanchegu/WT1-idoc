e-Campus


Usually, when we think of e-commerce functionality, we imagine fashion and electronic gadget shops online, 
but what about processing admission fees for higher education? Without a stable and highly customized fee 
processing module in place, students would be unable to complete the application process from the comfort of their homes.

Designing and developing a completely online application and fee payment process would be the focus for this project. Though minimal off-the-shelf software would be used in the project, it is mainly built from strach. Being a non-local my self, the solution mainly helps students of the institution to complete this process online, thus reducing paperwork and processing time to a great extent.

The student records are maintained in sync with the university records, enabling support for change of course and other related issues, thus enabling a dynamic environment for existing students to pay their fees. 

The candidates applying to the university are allowed to pay application fee through the online payment aggregators. New candidates are supposed to signup whereas existing candidates log in. Support for multi-phase completion of the application process would be provided.

Using a database would be inevitable for the case, we choose either SQL or MongoDB to resolve the issue and to provide a smooth, streamlined user experience.  

Integrating Payment Gateways to the project becomes easier than ever, thanks to API services of the respective financial platforms being provided for the sake of developers which provides students and candidates to pay through Bank accounts, credit cards, debit cards, Mobile Wallets, Net banking etc, currently, PayTM and others. Thus, we try to develop a fully functioning model which with minimal modifications would suit a large scale industrial level ready-to-use Web Application need.
